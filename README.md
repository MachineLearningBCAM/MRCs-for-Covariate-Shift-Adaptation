This repository is the official implementation of [Double-Weighting for General Covariate Shift Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08637). 

The algorithm proposed in the paper provides efficient learning for the proposed Doble-Weighting for General Covariate Shift (DW-GCS). In particular, we first compute weights $\alpha$ and $\beta$ by solving the Double-Weighting Kernel Mean Matching (DW-KMM). Then, we learn the classifier's parameters by solving the MRC using double-weighting.

## Python Code

### Requirements

The standard libraries required are listed in the file `requirements.txt`. To install these libraries using

1) `pip`
```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2) `conda` environment
```
conda create --name <environment_name> --file requirements.txt
```

In addition, the implementation of the proposed algorithm utilizes the MOSEK optimizer for which license can be downloaded from [here](https://www.mosek.com/products/academic-licenses/).

## Matlab Code

[Matlab_code](https://github.com/MachineLearningBCAM/MRCs-for-Covariate-Shift-Adaptation/tree/main/Matlab_Code%20) folder contains Matlab scripts required to execute the method:

* run_DWGCS_example1.m and run_DWGCS_example1.m are the main files. 
* run_DWGCS_example1.m file perform a experiment for datasets in which we artificially introduce the covariate shift. 
* run_DWGCS_example2.m file perform a experiment using the “News20groups” dataset that is intrinsically affected by a covariate shift since the training and testing partitions correspond to different times. 
* In such files we can modify the feature mapping, and the loss we are going to use.
* The functions in the folder [CovShift_Generation](https://github.com/MachineLearningBCAM/MRCs-for-Covariate-Shift-Adaptation/tree/main/Matlab_Code%20/CovShift_Generation) generate covariate shift in the datasets. In particular, we select training and testing samples with different probabilities based on the medians of the first 3 features, and based on the median of the first principal component of features.
* phi.m calculates the feature mappings using linear, polinomial or random Fourier features (RFF).
* DWGCS_weights.m computes the estimated weights $\beta$ and $\alpha$ solving the double-weighting kernel mean matching.
* DWGCS_parameters.m obtains mean vector estimate $\tau$ and confidence vector $\lambda$.
* DWGCS_learning.m solves the convex MRC optimization problem using double-weighting and obtains the classifier parameters.
* DWGCS_prediction.m assigns labels to instances and gives the classification error.
